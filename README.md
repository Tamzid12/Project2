# Project2

This project is part of the coursework for my Data Structure class. All codes are in C++

1. Question 6

The question asked to use a stack to pass in a string, and print out the string each word reversed. The question also asked that we use an input file to store the strings we want to pass in, instead of asking the user to enter string(s).

2. Question 2

This question asked to write a prefix stack and show how it works (in the main).
